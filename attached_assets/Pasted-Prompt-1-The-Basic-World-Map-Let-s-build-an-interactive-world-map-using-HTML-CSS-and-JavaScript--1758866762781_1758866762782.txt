Prompt 1: The Basic World Map
"Let's build an interactive world map using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Please use the Leaflet.js library for the map.

Create a simple index.html file that links to a style.css and a script.js file. The map should fill the entire browser window. Center the initial view on Southeast Asia and set a gentle, light-colored map tile layer, like one from CartoDB or Stamen."

Prompt 2: Plotting the "Compute Rich"
"Now, let's plot the GPU locations from the image as dots on the map. In the script.js file, create a placeholder JavaScript array with the approximate latitude and longitude for about 10-15 of the locations shown in the image.

Use the legend from the image: make the H100 dots dark purple, the A100 dots light blue, and the V100 dots orange-red. Add these dots to the map as circle markers."

Prompt 3: Adding Pop-up Information
"Let's make the dots interactive. When a user clicks on one of the GPU location dots, it should open a pop-up.

The pop-up should display simple information like:

GPU Type: 'NVIDIA H100'

Status: 'Compute Rich'

Location: 'City, Country'

Please add this functionality to the circle markers we created in the previous step."

Prompt 4: Visualizing the "Compute South" & "Compute Desert"
"This is the most important step. Let's add shaded regions to the map to represent the 'Compute South' and 'Compute Desert.'

Using the GeoJSON format, create two large, semi-transparent colored overlays on the map:

A yellow overlay covering the approximate regions of the 'Compute South' (e.g., Southeast Asia, South America, Africa).

A slightly darker orange overlay covering a region that represents a 'Compute Desert' (e.g., a large part of Central Africa).

When a user clicks on these shaded regions, show a pop-up with a title like 'The Compute South' and a short, one-sentence definition."

Prompt 5: Creating the Legend and Controls
"Now, let's add a legend and some simple controls to make the map easy to understand.

In the top-right corner, create a legend that clearly explains what the dot colors and the shaded regions mean.

Also, add a layer control box in the top-left that allows the user to toggle the H100, A100, and V100 dot layers on and off. This will help users see the distribution of different generations of compute."

Prompt 6: Adding a Simple Narrative Element
"Finally, let's add a simple title and a one-sentence introduction to frame the story for the user.

At the top of the page, outside the map, add a main title: 'The Unseen Empire: Mapping the Global Compute Landscape.'

Below the title, add a subtitle: 'This map reveals the stark divide between the "Compute Rich" nations and the emerging "Compute South," highlighting a critical challenge for global AI governance.'"
